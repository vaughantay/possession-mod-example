This is a sample mod file for [Possession](http://possessiongame.com/ "Possession"). It contains a new special level, the Sunken City, with its own tileset, creatures, spells, features, projectile sand effects.

It's intended as an example of the type of content you can put in a mod. It's not really playtested, so no guarantees are made as to if it's balanced or fun.
